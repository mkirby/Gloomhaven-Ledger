    'description': "The Inox are a primative and barbaric race, preferring to live in small nomadic tribes scattered across the wilderness. There, they subsist through hunting and gathering, scraping together a meager existance while fighting off the more dangerous creatures of the wilds. What they lack in intelligence and sophistication, they make up for with their superior strength and size, always eager to prove themselves in a challenge. And one should certianly take care in challenging an Inox. Their society does not pay much heed to ethics or morality. For the Inox, it is all about survival - kill or be killed. \n\n There is a class of Inox, however, who have abandoned their nomadic ways to embrace life in human cities, employing their great size and strength to earn a more comfortable living. Disparagingly called 'Brutes' by those who employ them, the Inox perform many taks of menial labor, from construction to loading and unloading ships. Less savory types have also been known to hire Brutes as extra muscle. Ideology matters little to the Brute when given a chance to show his strength and get paid to do it."

    'description': "Because of their diminutive size, the Quartryl feel they have a lot to prove. From an early age, they are encouraged to study as much as possible about many different subjects. Though there are expert Quatryls in any field, they seem to have a particular affinity to engineering and machinery. Their long, delicate fingers allow them to build all manner of intricate contraptions to make life easier and augment their inferior physical strength. Though they are not numerous, Quatryls can easily integrate themselves into any society due to their expertise in critical fields an their charming, graceful demeanor. Only a fool would shun a Quatryl's offer to help. \n\n The Tinkerer is a fairly common class of Quatryl to be found in a large city. They are expert's in crafting all manner of gadgets and elixirs, and they typically make a living selling them to those wishing to indulge in the convienence these creations offer. There are more adventurous Tinkerers, however, who travel beyond a city's walls, using all the tools at their disposal to brave the wilds in attempts to uncover ancient curiosities that may give insight into their research."

    'description': "The Orchids are an anchient meditative race from somewhere across the Misty Sea. They view the happenings of the world through a detached perspective that their thousand-year lifetimes allow. For the Orchids, life is about spending the spending the proper amount of time on thought and reflection, so that the right decision can be made at the right time without hesitation. Orchid have been known to get lost in thought for years, and during this meditation, crystals will begin to slowly grow on their skins. Since Orchids have little need for physical comforts and draw their sustenence from the earth, they serve little purpose in normal society. Many believe that the increased presence of Orchids in Gloomhaven in recent years is evidence of an approaching catastrophe. \n\n\ Through deep meditation, some Orchids arrive at the conclusion that proper action requires not only thought and discussion, but also force. There are many physical threats to the Orchid society, and some are called to join the ancient order of Spellweavers - Orchid sages who are able to to draw forth powerful natural force and craft them into concentrated attacks. Some Spellweavers choose to remain with their society to act as guards against outside threats, but others choose to travel the world, destroying these threats wherever they find them."

    'description': "Humans are by far the most dominant of the races, spreading across the continent like locusts, erecting extravagant cities and disturbing slumbering forces they can never understand. The human society is one of rules and regulations, but also one of great diversity. Due to their intense curiosity and relentless nature, humans can find themselves walking almost any path imaginable - from obscenely weathly noble to the unappreciated tavern cool; from blacksmith forging rugged weaponry to the corrupted pursuant of dark magics. \n\n It is natural, then, that while many humans work to build complex and constricting bureaucratic societies, there are others who reject such societies or even work to tear them down. Scoundrels are amoung this second type, wholly unscrupulous and self-serving. Scoundrels operate under the assumption that everything in the world is their to take and they will do whatever is necesary to do the taking. Such an attitube manifests itself in combat through vicious opportunism unseem in any other culture."

    'description': "The Savvas value power above all else. This severe and exclusionary race has rocky, uneven skin except for their chests, which appear as smooth, transparent glass. Beneath the surface of that glass is teh manifestation of their power - energy cores fashioned from the elements they have mastered. Ice, fire, air, earth - before a Savvas masters at least one of these elements and obtains its power as their own, they are considered to be noting. Thus, from an early age, Savvas children study feverishly to gain mastery over a single element, typically spending 20 years of devoted effort to do so. Some Savvas have been known to live among other races, using their elemental mastery in one form or another, but this is largely frowned upon by the majority of Savvas as a base and primitive way to live. \n\n There are many Savvas who never obtain the mastery of an element, and are exiled from the society, having no choice but to live among the other races or in solitude. Before a Cragheart is exiled, however, they earn thier name by having their chest cavity marred and shattered, forever reminding them of their inadequacy. But Craghearts are not without their sstrngths. Even with no control or mastery, they still have an affinity for their native earth and can display great feats of strength with their rocky stature."

    'description': "Vermlings are a scavenging, animalistic race. They feed off the flesh of the dead, and when they can't any of that, they are more than happy to do the killing themselves with crude knives and arrows. They are primitive and weak-willed - easily controlled by more powerful races with the right combination of pandering and intimidation. Left to their own devices, Vermlings typically form hunting packs and spend their short lives fulfilling basic needs. Some Vermlings do make their way into human society, but they are universally shunned and feared in such settings, forced to live in dark alleys and feed off scraps. \n\n Often city-dwelling Vermlings will flee to the sewers to escape harassment. There, without their pack to connect with, these Vermlings will form strong bonds with the massive rat population. Communication with such a large number of creatures can strain one's mind, though. Where most Vermlings fail, some rise to the challenge and hone powerful psychic abilities to control the swarms. So-called Mindtheives make terrifying opponents through the use of psychic assaults, sharp blades, and swarms of tiny teeth."
